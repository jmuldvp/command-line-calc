# command-line-calc

Assignment from my Bloc apprenticeship: Create a command line calculator.

In a career prep section of my studies, I was given the choice of 3 "take home" assignments and I was given 24 hours to complete it. I chose the command line calculator because I felt I needed to brush up on my Ruby since it's been awhile since I used it in my studies.

Because I found out about eval pretty quick (code found in calc.rb) and finished the assignment, I felt I should redo the assignment without `eval()` and created the code in calc2.rb.
